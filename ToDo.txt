Algorithmic optimization
* Per mainstat search to improve convergence
* Floor for sum of artifact scores to deepen search
* Add best single stat artifacts
* Some simple lagrangian solver
Low level optimization
* Vector statlines - linear V6
* Store builds prepartitioned
Refactoring
* Split build info - forgot what it meant T_T
* Make best build informasion struct that will store build info max damage statline
Test
* Investigation tool for single case
Fix/Feature
* Artifacts generation produses DMG and DMGb. Can do it normally now, but it is not important.
